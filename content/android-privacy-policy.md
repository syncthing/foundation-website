# Syncthing-Android Privacy Policy

The app syncthing-android does not collect any user information.

The app does not store any location data. It requires the permission to access the location in the background, to look up the currently active Wi-Fi's SSID. That information is used to enable syncing only on user-configurable Wi-Fi's. The app never actually looks up your location in the process, and thus doesn't use or store location data.

The app uses the camera solely to scan QR-codes to enter a device ID. Pictures are not stored in the process.

It does run Syncthing, which may collect anonymous usage-data only if you actively opt-in to it or run betas/release candidates. This documentation article has specific information on this: https://docs.syncthing.net/users/security.html
