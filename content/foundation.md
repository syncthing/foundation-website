# The Syncthing Foundation

The Syncthing Foundation is a registered Swedish non-profit foundation.
The foundation bylaws have this to say about the purpose of the foundation:

> The purpose of the foundation is to maintain and encourage development and
> usage of the free software Syncthing and its required infrastructure. The
> foundation can provide grants on its own initiative, or by application
> according to the rules put forth by the board.

This is quite general, and in practice it means the foundation pays for the
infrastructure required to run Syncthing (like the syncthing.net website,
discovery servers, build servers, and so on), but is open to providing grants
for specific projects that further the cause.
