## Integrations

These are some popular and user friendly OS integrations, providing things like system tray icons, file browser integration, etc. These are good starting points if you are a new user unfamiliar with Syncthing, or not prone to loving the command line.

- **[SyncTrayzor](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/releases/latest)**:
  Windows tray utility, filesystem watcher & launcher
- **[syncthing-macos](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/releases/latest)**:
  macOS application bundle

There's a wealth of further integrations of all kinds listed on the [community
contributions](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html) page. Each
integration has their own issue tracker for integration-specific issues, but
discussion and assistance for all of them is welcome on the
[forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/).


## Android

The Android app is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/).
